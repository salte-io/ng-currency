## 0.11.1

* Fixed a bug that caused empty ngModel values to get marked as invalid when the min was set to anything above zero or the max was set to anything below zero

## 0.11.0

* Added support for forcing the ngModel value to stay within the min/max range (hard-cap)
* Removed isolated scope
* Created a build process for Travis CI to catch linting and unit test errors
* Refactored the unit tests to reduce duplication

## 0.10.x

* Migrated scope bindings to use `attrs.$observe`

**Migration from 0.9.x!**
Bindings should be updated to use the curly brace syntax

## 0.9.x

* Focusing on an input will show the model value rather then the formatted value

## 0.8.x

* Updated to Angular 1.3.x

## 0.7.x

* Supports Angular 1.2.x
