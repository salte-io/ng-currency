[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aguirrel/ng-currency.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aguirrel/ng-currency)

ngCurrency is a directive that enables seamless use of currency inputs.

Main features:

* The model is consistent as it values is a float (even if there are alpha caracters in the middle) or NaN in the empty case.
* Input value is always filtered with locale currency when load and on blur.
* You may write the amount using locale decimal or use dot (.) as default.
* The only required dependency is [angular](https://github.com/angular/angular.js)!
* Min and Max validators like input[number].
* Enable/disable formatter using ng-currency={{var}}
* Optional fraction places value. The default remains 2 decimal places.
* You can redraw all directives broadcasting "currencyRedraw" event.
* Enable/Disable show zeroes using display-zeroes 'true' or 'false'
* Not isolated scope. It plays well with others directives!

## Versions

* 0.10.x vs 0.9.x

Now directive plays well with others directives, mainly "scope" was removed and now only use attrs variables.
**If you migrate from 0.9.x!** Main impact in this new change is if you use something like min="minvar", you should change it to min="{{minvar}}".

* 0.9.x vs 0.8.x

When you focus on input with ng-currency directive, model value will be displayed instead of currency formatted text (I.E: instead of 1,40 € will be 1.4 on focus)  .  So it's easier to use only numeric pad.

* 0.7.x vs 0.8.x

If you use angular 1.2.x please, use 0.7.x version (v0.7.0 branch). If you use angular 1.3.x or above just use 0.8.x version instead (master branch).

## Example

You may see it in action and play a lot using [plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/u9mJqDH8UpwxDnOv8gZL?p=preview).

## Quick start

+ Include the required libraries:

>
``` html
<script src="https://code.angularjs.org/1.3.4/angular.js"></script>
<script src="https://rawgit.com/aguirrel/ng-currency/master/dist/ng-currency.js"></script>
```

+ Inject the `ngCurrency` module into your app:

>
``` JavaScript
angular.module('myApp', ['ng-currency']);
```

+ In your input tag

>
``` html
<input type="text" model="yourModel" ng-currency />
```

+ It is also possible to add 'min' and 'max' validations

>
``` html
<input type="text" model="yourModel" ng-currency min="1" max="1337" />
```

+ If you want to be able to dynamically enable/disable validations from a controller you can use the following

>
``` html
<input type="text" model="yourModel" ng-currency min="1" max="1337" ng-required="true" />
```

+ It already shows the default currency symbol, but you can define a currency symbol, so that it will use this instead.

>
``` html
<input type="text" model="yourModel" ng-currency currency-symbol="¥" />
```

+ Disable currency in field

>
``` html
<input type="text" model="yourModel" ng-currency={{isCurrency}} currency-symbol="¥" />
```

+ Optional fraction value to take advantage of the currency filter's third param. The default remains 2 decimal places.

>
``` html
  <input type="text" ng-currency min="0" fraction="0">
```
